# Large-Scale Analysis of Framework-Specific Exceptions in Android Apps 
 
## Overview

* We conduct a large-scale analysis of framework-specific exceptions in Android apps. 
* To achieve this, we constructed a comprehensive dataset that contains 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source apps. 
* We also demonstrate the usefulness on two prototype tools.
